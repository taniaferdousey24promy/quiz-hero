            <h3>Ques-2: What is the difference between Local storage, Session storage and Cookies ?</h3>
            <p><strong>Answer: </strong> 
            </p>

            <ol type="1">
                <li><strong>Cookies</strong>= Cookies are small text files that are stored on the user's computer and can be accessed by both client-side and server-side scripts.
                </li>
                <p>Local storage and session storage are HTML5 features that allow websites to store data on the user's computer. But</p>
                <li><strong>Local storage </strong>= local storage data persists even after the browser is closed
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>session storage</strong>= session storage data is deleted when the browser is closed.
                </li>
                <p>Both local storage and session storage can only be accessed by client-side scripts.</p>

            <h3>Ques-3: What is Event Loop and how does it work ?</h3>
            <p><strong>Answer: </strong> The event loop has simple job to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. It is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks.</p>
            <ol type ="a">
                <li>When an event or task is registered, it is added to a queue known as the "task queue". The Event Loop then continuously checks this queue for pending tasks. If there are tasks waiting to be executed, the Event Loop takes each task from the queue one by one, and executes it.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Once a task is executed, the Event Loop checks if any other tasks have been added to the queue. If there are, it executes them in the same way, otherwise it waits for new tasks to be added to the queue before checking it again.
            <br>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>This process of constantly checking the task queue for pending tasks, executing them one by one, and then waiting for new tasks to be added is what allows asynchronous programs to be non-blocking, and allows them to handle multiple operations concurrently.
                </li>

            <h3>Ques 4: Inside noChange.js file what's the importance of quizTimer() function?

            </h3>
            <p><strong>Answer: </strong>quizTimer() function gets called by getting boolean values as argument. This function check if the parameter is truthy . If it is truth then it calls another function called clearInterval() to stop the time interval. <br><br>

                if the parameter gives falsy value it will call setInterval() function which sets an interval . Which repeats in every second. Inside this function if count is less than 60 the code  changes the color of text in html between red and dark red in every 2 seconds . <br><br>
                
                This function is used to update a timer display on this webpage . It can be dismissed by passing a truthy value to dismiss parameter.</p>

            <h3>Ques 5: Inside noChange.js file what's the importance of chooseQuiz() function?

            </h3>
            <p><strong>Answer: </strong>chooseQuiz function takes two parameters - index and givenAns .This function checks if an object answer has the same id as the current quiz question by using find() . It checks if the id property of the element is same as the id property of current quiz question. <br><br>
                This function updates the answers array with the user's chosen answers for a given quiz question and displays using displayAnswers() function.</p>
