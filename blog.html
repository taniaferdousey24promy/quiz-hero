            </p>

            <ol type="1">
                <li><strong>Cookies</strong>= Cookies are small text files that are stored on the user's computer and can be accessed by both client-side and server-side scripts.
                </li>
                <p>Local storage and session storage are HTML5 features that allow websites to store data on the user's computer. But</p>
                <li><strong>Local storage </strong>= local storage data persists even after the browser is closed
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>session storage</strong>= session storage data is deleted when the browser is closed.
                </li>
                <p>Both local storage and session storage can only be accessed by client-side scripts.</p>
